# Shopping Cart Project

## Overview

This project is a simple Shopping Cart web application. It allows users to browse items, add items to their cart, view their cart, and perform basic cart operations such as incrementing/decrementing item quantities and removing items. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, with localStorage to manage the cart state.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays a list of products with images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Cart Management**: Allows adding items to the cart, removing items, and adjusting quantities.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Persists cart data across page reloads using localStorage.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts layout for various screen sizes.

### HTML Files
- **index.html:** The homepage displaying the list of available products.
- **cart.html:** The cart page displaying items added to the cart and allowing for quantity adjustments and item removals.
### JavaScript Files
